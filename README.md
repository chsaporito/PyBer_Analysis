# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
- The purpose of this analysis is to summarize the ride-sharing data by aggregating the data into “Total Rides”, “Total Drivers”, “Total Fares”, “Average Fare per Ride” and “Average Fare per Driver” for each city type.  City types consist of “Rural”, “Suburban”, and “Urban” cities.  This will help give us a clearer understanding of how the cost of fares compares for each city type.
- To finalize the analysis, a line chart will show the weekly total fares by city type.  This will help visualize the sum total of “weekly fares”  that can be compared to the “average fares” in the first summary.

## Results:
- There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
## Summary:
- There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
